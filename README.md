# Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 test network-config

Required Dockerfiles and configuration files (certificates, channel definition and genesis_block)
to create a HLF network with one orderer, two organizations each with its own certification authority (ca)
and each with one peer (the state of the peers is stored in a CouchDB container)
